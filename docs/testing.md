# Quality Assurance Strategy

## 1. Quality Assurance Strategy Overview

The Quality Assurance strategy mandates the integration of robust testing practices throughout the development lifecycle to ensure the scalability, reliability, and maintainability of the Next.js application. This strategy requires a tiered approach to testing, encompassing unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

## 2. Testing Framework and Dependencies

A robust testing framework must be integrated to facilitate comprehensive quality assurance.

### 2.1 Development Dependencies

The following tools shall be included in the project's `devDependencies` to establish a standard testing environment:

| Tool | Purpose | Source Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jest** | Primary JavaScript testing framework. | Found listed in `devDependencies` as `jest` and related configurations (`@types/jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`). |
| **React Testing Library (RTL)** | Utility for testing React components, focusing on user experience. | Found listed in `devDependencies` as `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`. |

### 2.2 Code Coverage Requirement

It is a **mandatory requirement** to set up and maintain code coverage reporting. Code coverage tracking must be implemented (e.g., using a service like Codecov) to monitor and ensure adequate test coverage is consistently maintained across the application.

## 3. Testing Strategy: Levels of Testing

A clear testing strategy must be established, partitioning testing efforts into three primary categories:

1.  **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual components and utility functions in isolation. For Next.js development, this includes ensuring modularity and reusability of components and logic.
2.  **Integration Tests:** Focus on verifying how different parts of the application interact, such as testing data flow between components or verifying component interactions with API mock layers.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Focus on validating complete user flows from start to finish, simulating a userâ€™s interaction with the entire application.

## 4. Critical Next.js Feature Testing Requirements

Given the reliance on the Next.js App Router, specific testing must be performed to confirm the correct functionality of core routing and error handling conventions.

### 4.1 Route Types Functionality Testing

Testing must confirm the correct behavior and accessibility of all major file-system routing patterns:

| Route Type | Next.js Convention | Testing Requirement | Source Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Routes** | Defined by directories containing a `page.js` or `.tsx` file (e.g., `/app/page.js` or `/app/blog/page.js`). | Validate that standard, non-dynamic paths resolve correctly and display the expected content. | |
| **Dynamic Routes** | Defined using folders enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `[slug]`). | Verify that dynamic segments resolve correctly and that the page component receives the necessary parameters (`params` prop) to render content based on the route segment value. | |
| **Nested Routes** | Created by nesting folders under the `app/` directory (e.g., `app/about/form/page.js`). | Confirm that the nested URL structure is correctly mapped to the corresponding directory structure and that layouts are inherited or scoped correctly. | |
| **Parallel Routes** | Defined using named slots (`@folder` convention) and rendered simultaneously within the parent `layout.js` file. | Verify that pages defined in parallel route slots (`@growth`, `@revenue`) render correctly when accessed via the parent route (e.g., `/dashboard`). Also, confirm that these slots are **not** directly accessible as URL segments (e.g., `/dashboard/@growth` should not be a route). | |

### 4.2 Programmatic Navigation Validation

Tests must validate the functionality of programmatic navigation using the `useRouter` hook, which allows changing routes without the `Link` component:

1.  **`router.push(url)`**: Validate that this method handles client-side transitions and adds a new entry to the browser history stack, as intended for standard navigation.
2.  **`router.replace(url)`**: Validate that this method performs navigation without adding a new entry to the history stack (similar to the `replace` prop on `next/link`), preventing the user from navigating back to the previous page using the browser back button.
3.  **`router.prefetch(url)`**: Validate that this method successfully prefetches the necessary resources for the target URL to ensure faster client-side transitions, particularly useful for non-standard navigations.

### 4.3 Specialized File Functionality Confirmation

Tests must confirm that special Next.js files correctly handle application errors and missing routes, which are critical aspects of error handling:

1.  **`error.js` (Runtime Errors)**: Confirm that the presence of an `error.js` file at a route segment correctly intercepts runtime errors occurring within that segment or its children. Verification must include ensuring the `error.js` component is correctly defined as a client component using the `'use client'` directive.
2.  **`not-found.js` (404/Missing Routes)**: Confirm that `not-found.js` correctly intercepts and displays the expected UI when an unmatched route is visited. Furthermore, tests should confirm that invoking the `notFound()` function programmatically stops rendering the current segment and triggers the nearest `not-found.js` file.

### Test Scenario Links to Requirements and Implementation

Each test scenario is linked to user stories in [Requirements](requirements.md#error-handling) and implemented features in [Implementation](implementation.md#state-management).

### Standards Alignment

TODO: Define how this document should follow standards for formatting, naming, architecture, security, testing, and documentation. Reference any existing standards.md if applicable.
