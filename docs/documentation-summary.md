# Documentation Enhancement Summary

This summary provides an overview of the documentation editing and context preparation phase for the Next.js boilerplate project.

## Files Updated

All 7 markdown files in the `docs/` directory have been enhanced with standardized sections, context tables, cross-links, and placeholders for future AI coding prompts:

- ai_guidelines.md
- requirements.md
- architecture.md
- implementation.md
- testing.md
- security.md
- sop.md

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. Purpose Declaration
Each file now starts with a clear statement of its purpose in the project workflow.

### 2. Project Context Table
Standardized context tables added to all files with fields like:
- Project Name
- Domain / Industry
- Stakeholders / Personas / Users
- Technologies / Frameworks
- Business Objectives
- Functional / Non-functional Requirements
- Constraints
- Deployment Environments
- Metrics / KPIs
- Security / Risk Assumptions

### 3. Clarifying Questions and Placeholders
Embedded TODO: and ? markers where context needs specification or clarification.

### 4. Standards Alignment Sections
TODO sections added for future definition of how each document follows standards for formatting, naming, architecture, security, testing, and documentation.

### 5. Cross-Linking Documentation
- Requirements links to testing scenarios and implemented features.
- Architecture links to implementation strategies.
- Testing links to requirements and implementation.
- Security links to architecture decisions and SEO practices.
- SOP links to implementation and deployment flows.

### 6. Consistent Formatting
- MoSCoW prioritization in requirements.
- Bullet points and tables for clarity.
- Clear headings and subheadings.

### 7. Future Code Generation Templates
Added "Prompt Templates for CLine Coding" sections with specific prompts for implementing features later, such as:
- Route structures and components
- Authentication and security features
- Testing configurations
- Deployment setups

## Unanswered Questions and TODO Items

### ai_guidelines.md
- Business Objectives: TODO
- Functional Requirements: TODO (in context table)
- Non-functional Requirements: TODO
- Deployment Environments: TODO: Production servers, CI/CD pipelines
- Metrics / KPIs: TODO (in context table)
- Security / Risk Assumptions: TODO (in context table)
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### requirements.md
- Functional Requirements: TODO: Define user stories and features (in context table)
- Metrics / KPIs: TODO: Page load times, error rates (in context table)
- Security / Risk Assumptions: TODO: Secure data handling, authentication needs (in context table)
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### architecture.md
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### implementation.md
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### testing.md
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### security.md
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

### sop.md
- Standards Alignment: TODO: Define how this document should follow standards...

## Sections Requiring Manual Input

1. **Standards Definition**: All files have placeholders for defining adherence to external standards (formatting, naming, architecture, security, testing, documentation). If a `standards.md` file exists or will be created, reference it here.

2. **Detailed Functional Requirements**: The requirements.md file has a placeholder for defining specific user stories and features. Manual input needed to expand beyond the current high-level MoSCoW items.

3. **Metrics and KPIs**: Several tables have TODO items for specific measurable goals (e.g., page load times, test coverage percentages, deployment frequency).

4. **Security Risk Assumptions**: TODO items for specific risks and assumptions in requirements, architecture, and other files.

5. **Business Objectives**: Some files have TODO for specific business objectives beyond the generic descriptions.

6. **Deployment Environments**: Specific environments (development, staging, production) need detailed specification.

## Next Steps

Once this documentation phase is complete, a separate coding phase can begin using the AI coding prompts and context established here. The enhanced documentation provides a solid foundation for consistent, standards-aligned development across all project domains: requirements, architecture, implementation, testing, security, and operations.

All documents are now prepared as "document-ready" versions with embedded context and cross-references to ensure future AI-generated code adheres to the established guidelines.
