### System Design Overview: Next.js App Router Boilerplate

This boilerplate utilizes the Next.js App Router, which leverages advanced features of React Server Components (RSC) and a powerful file-system based routing system to build scalable, maintainable, and performant full-stack applications.

---

### 1. Routing Architecture

The core routing system is governed by a **file-system based routing** convention housed within the top-level `app/` directory.

*   **Route Definition:** A directory (folder) within `app/` indicates a route or a route segment, and nesting folders creates nested routes. The application's root route (`/`) is defined by the top-level `app/` directory.
*   **Page Content:** The page content for a specific route is defined by the special file named `page.js` (or `.ts`/`.tsx`) located within the corresponding route directory. A route becomes publicly accessible only when a `page.js` or `route.js` file exists within the segment.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Dynamic route segments are defined using square brackets in the folder name, such as `[name]` or `[slug]`, allowing the creation of routes that match dynamic data.

### 2. Structural Organization and Reusability

The architecture maximizes code organization and reuse through colocation, nested layouts, and route grouping.

#### A. Colocation and Component Architecture
The Next.js App Router improves development experience through **Colocation**, which involves organizing and managing pages alongside other related files (like layouts and components) within the same `app/` directory.

*   **Safety:** While folders define the route structure, a route is not publicly accessible until it contains a `page.js` or `route.js` file. This means that **project files** (such as UI utilities or internal logic) can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally becoming routable paths.
*   **Modularity:** The architecture encourages building applications with a **component architecture** that follows a tree hierarchy, promoting modularity and reuse of components and utility functions.

#### B. Nested Layouts (`layout.js`)
The system employs **Nested Layouts** using the special `layout.js` file to maximize code reusability.

*   **Shared UI:** The `layout.js` file is used for defining shared UI (such as headers or navigation) across multiple child routes or segments.
*   **Hierarchy:** Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. Layout components are rendered recursively in nested routes, ensuring that the components of a child route segment are nested inside the components of its parent segment.
*   **Optimization:** During client-side navigation between pages that share a layout, the layout **does not re-render** and remains interactive.

#### C. Route Groups (`(folderName)`)
**Route Groups** allow developers to organize routes logically within the `app/` directory without impacting the resulting URL path.

*   **Structural Advantage:** Route groups are created by wrapping a folder name in parentheses, such as `(marketing)` or `(shop)`. This indicates that the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.
*   **Layout Scope:** They are particularly useful for enabling nested layouts, allowing the creation of multiple root layouts or applying a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment.

### 3. Parallel Rendering

The architecture uses **Parallel Routing** to enhance dashboard-like features where independent sections need to render simultaneously.

*   **Simultaneous Rendering:** Parallel Routing allows one or more pages/components to render simultaneously within the same layout.
*   **Named Slots:** Parallel routes are defined using named slots, established with the **`@slot` (or `@folder`) convention** (e.g., `@growth` or `@revenue`).
*   **Integration:** These named slots are automatically received by the parent layout component as props and are rendered within the layout's JSX structure.
*   **Isolation:** Each parallel route can define its own independent loading state (`loading.js`) and error state (`error.js`). Note that these slots are *not* actual route segments and cannot be accessed via a dedicated route path.

### 4. Data Fetching Paradigm

The primary data fetching paradigm relies heavily on React Server Components (RSC).

*   **Server Component Direct Fetching:** The App directory, enforcing server-side rendering by default, supports **async React Server Components** (RSC) which can use `async`/`await` to directly fetch data.
*   **Sensitive Data Requests:** A key benefit is the ability to **safely perform sensitive data requests (like database calls) directly in the component**. Since RSCs execute all data fetching on the server, there is no risk of leaking credentials or secrets, **removing the need for an intermediary API route** for securing data retrieval.
*   **Recommendation:** Next.js recommends fetching all data on the server, either via an RSC or a Route Handler.

### 5. Backend Architecture: Route Handlers

The backend services are developed using **Next.js Route Handlers**.

*   **API Implementation:** Route Handlers implement API services, replacing the older API routes used in the Pages Router.
*   **File Convention:** They are defined by creating a special file named `route.js` (or `.ts`) inside the relevant `app` folder (e.g., `app/api/route.js`).
*   **Supported Methods:** Route Handlers leverage the Request and Response APIs and support standard HTTP methods, including: **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATH, HEAD, and OPTIONS**.

### 6. Security Considerations in Architecture

Architecture decisions impact security practices, such as server-side data fetching to prevent credential leaks. See [Security Document](security.md#data-security) for risks related to these designs.

### Standards Alignment

TODO: Define how this document should follow standards for formatting, naming, architecture, security, testing, and documentation. Reference any existing standards.md if applicable.

- Implement layout.js components for shared UI across routes
- Build parallel routes using @slot conventions
- Create Route Handlers for backend API services with support for standard HTTP methods
- Develop TypeScript interfaces for dynamic route parameters
- Generate middleware for routing logic and security checks
