| Domain / Industry | Web application development |
| Stakeholders | Developers, AI assistants, end-users |
| Personas / Users | Full-stack developers, software engineers |
| Technologies / Frameworks | Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| Business Objectives | Deliver a robust, scalable Next.js application boilerplate |
| Functional Requirements | TODO: Define user stories and features |
| Non-functional Requirements | Performance, scalability, maintainability |
| Constraints | Must use Next.js App Router, modern React features |
| Deployment Environments | Development, staging, production |
| Metrics / KPIs | TODO: Page load times, error rates |
| Security / Risk Assumptions | TODO: Secure data handling, authentication needs |

## 1. System Prerequisites

To ensure stable development and deployment of the application, the following environment prerequisites must be met:

| Requirement | Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Node.js** | **v18.18.0 or later** must be installed. Next.js installation typically requires Node.js v18.x or above. | |
| **Next.js** | The latest stable version of Next.js should be used, with the **App Router** enabled during project creation. | |
| **Development OS** | Support for macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux operating systems. | |

## 2. Core Application Framework

The application must be built as a full-stack web application using the Next.js App Router, leveraging modern React features for optimal performance and structure.

| Requirement | Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | The core application must exclusively utilize the **Next.js App Router**. The App Router is the recommended approach for new projects, replacing the older Pages Router. | |
| **Component Architecture** | The application must leverage the capabilities of **React Server Components (RSC)**, which the App Router supports. Each route page (`page.js` or `.tsx`) is, by default, a ReactJS server component. | |
| **Layout Management** | The application structure must utilize the App Router's file-system based routing to implement **nested layouts** using the dedicated `layout.js` (or `.tsx`) file convention. Layouts defined at any level wrap their child segments. | |

## 3. Mandatory Features based on App Router Design Principles

### 3.1 Comprehensive Routing Capabilities

The application must demonstrate mastery of the file-system based routing principles of the App Router. Folders define URL segments, and a route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists within the directory.

| Feature | Convention/Usage | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Routes** | Defined by directories with known route segment names (e.g., `app/about/page.tsx` results in `/about`). | |
| **Nested Routes** | Created by nesting folders under the `app/` directory (e.g., `app/blog/authors/page.tsx` results in `/blog/authors`). | |
| **Dynamic Routes** | Parameterize segments using square brackets (e.g., `[segment]` or `[slug]`). Values are accessed via the `params` prop in the page component. | |
| **Catch-All Routes** | Defined using `[...segment]`. This matches multiple subsequent route segments (e.g., `/shop/clothing/shirts`). | |
| **Optional Catch-All Routes** | Defined using `[[...segment]]`. This allows matching a variable number of segments, including zero segments (e.g., `/docs` or `/docs/pages`). | |
| **Parallel Routing** | Renders one or more pages in the same layout simultaneously. Named slots are defined using the **`@folder`** convention (e.g., `@growth`) and are received as props in the parent layout. | |
| **Route Grouping** | Used for organizing routes logically without affecting the URL path. Group folders are wrapped in parentheses (e.g., **`(marketing)`**). | |

### 3.2 Robust Error Handling and Suspense Boundaries

The application must implement robust error management using dedicated special files and functions provided by the App Router.

| Feature | Convention/Usage | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime Error Handling** | Implemented using the dedicated **`error.js`** file within a route segment. The component exported from `error.js` must be a client component (using `'use client'`). | |
| **Loading States / Suspense** | Implemented using the **`loading.js`** file convention in a route segment to display loading UI (skeletons). This file automatically wraps the corresponding page in a `<Suspense>` boundary. | |
| **404 Not Found UI** | A customized 404 page must be implemented using **`not-found.js`** under the `app/` directory to handle any unmatched routes throughout the application. | |
| **Programmatic 404** | The built-in **`notFound()`** function must be used within a route segment to throw the `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error, which stops the current rendering process and displays the nearest `not-found.js` file. | |

### 3.3 Efficient Data Fetching

Data fetching must prioritize server-side operations using React Server Components to optimize performance and security.

| Feature | Convention/Usage | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server Data Fetching** | Data fetching must be performed directly using `async` React Server Components and the native **server-side `fetch`** function. This allows for direct, safe calls to sensitive resources (like databases) without needing an intermediary API route, as requests occur safely on the server. | |
| **Caching Support** | Server-side `fetch` requests must utilize Next.js's built-in caching features, supporting strategies similar to `getStaticProps` (e.g., `cache: 'force-cache'`). | |
| **Revalidation Support** | Fetch requests must support **time-based revalidation** to fetch data at specific intervals (similar to `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` option, e.g., `next: { revalidate: 10 }`). | |
| **Request Memoization** | The application must leverage Next.js's automatic **request memoization** for all `fetch` requests within the component tree, ensuring that duplicate requests for the same data do not incur performance penalties. | |

### 3.4 Integration of SEO and Metadata Requirements

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) must be integrated using the Next.js metadata API conventions specific to the App Router.

| Requirement | Convention/Usage | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metadata API** | Metadata requirements must be defined in layouts or pages using the Next.js **`export const metadata = {}`** object or the **`generateMetadata()`** function. | |
| **Mandatory Tags** | Every page must include essential SEO tags: `title` (keyword-focused, $\le$ 60 characters) and `description` (compelling, $\le$ 160 characters). | |
| **Social Sharing** | Implementation must include Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) and Twitter Card tags to optimize content for social sharing. | |
| **Generated Files** | The application structure should account for file conventions for automatic SEO generation, such as `sitemap.xml` or `sitemap.js` (Generated Sitemap), and `robots.txt` or `robots.js` (Generated Robots file). | |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### User Stories

The following user stories define the functional capabilities of the Next.js boilerplate:

- **Must:** As a developer, I want to create static and dynamic routes using the App Router, so that I can build navigable web pages.
- **Must:** As a developer, I want to implement nested layouts for consistent UI across pages, so that the application has a unified structure.
- **Should:** As a developer, I want error boundaries and loading states, so that users experience smooth interactions and error handling.
- **Must:** As a developer, I want server-side data fetching in Server Components, so that sensitive data is handled securely.
- **Could:** As a developer, I want SEO metadata integration, so that pages are optimized for search engines.
- **Should:** As a developer, I want type safety in routing links, so that I avoid build-time errors.

Each user story is linked to system components in [architecture.md](architecture.md#components).

### Non-Functional Requirements (Priority: MoSCoW)

- **Must:** Application load times under 2 seconds
- **Should:** Server-side rendering for initial page loads
- **Must:** TypeScript integration for type safety
- **Could:** Support for modern CSS frameworks
